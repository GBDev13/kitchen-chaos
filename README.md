Kitchen Chaos is a simple game inspired by the famous game [Overcooked](https://store.steampowered.com/app/448510/Overcooked/). This project was developed following [Code Monkey's tutorial](https://youtu.be/AmGSEH7QcDg) and was my first contact with game development, I decided to develop this project just for curiosity and I liked it a lot!
